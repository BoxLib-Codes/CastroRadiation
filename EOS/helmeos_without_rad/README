Differences between helmeos_without_rad and helmeos.  In helmeos.f90,
ssol (i.e., sigma) is set to zero.  Thus radiation is taken out from
EOS to avoid double counting.  

This is the general stellar equation of state developed by Frank
Timmes (ASU).  This version was downloaded from his website and the
interface was modified both for thread safety and to use a derived
type construct for passing thermodynamic quantities.  
We thank Frank for making this EOS available.
