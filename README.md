# Castro Radiation Module
*an adaptive mesh, astrophysical radiation hydrodynamics simulation code*

## Getting Started

To build CastroRadiation, you need a copy of the BoxLib library:

https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/index.html

and a copy of the Castro code:

https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/Castro

There is a User's Guide in `CastroRadiation/UsersGuide/` (type `make`
to build from LaTeX source) that will guide you through running your
first problem.
